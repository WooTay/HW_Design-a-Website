						<h2> What's Dubble Bubble?</h2>
							<section>
							<p>Dubble Bubble is a brand of pink-colored bubblegum invented by Walter E. Diemer, 
							an accountant at Philadelphia based Fleer Chewing Gum Company, in 1928. One of Diemerâ€™s 
							hobbies was concocting recipes for chewing gum based on the original Fleer ingredients. 
							Though founder Frank Fleer had come up with his own bubble gum recipe in 1906, it was 
							shelved due to its being too sticky and breaking apart too easily. It would be another 20 
							years until Diemer would use the original idea as inspiration for his invention.</p>
